Code, data analysis and simulation studies for the paper "Robust inference for parsimonious model-based clustering" 

This project reports R code for implementing the methods and reproducing
data analysis and simulation studies in Dotto and Farcomeni "Robust
inference for parsimonious model-based clustering"

The following libraries shall be installed in R before using code from
this project:

library(foreach)

library(mvtnorm) 

library(tclust)

library(robustbase)

library(lattice)

Code for the general methods is in folder mainCode, with some guidelines. 

To reproduce the data analysis, please refer to folder dataAnalysis.
